# m6ATEpre
## Introduction
The most prevalent mRNA modification, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) plays an important role in various RNA metabolism, including gene expression and translation. However, the selective mechanism by which m6A sites regulate mRNA translation through YTHDF1 binding remains poorly understood, due to a lack of computational methods for identifying context-specific m6A sites that regulate translation. To address this, we developed a novel computational framework named m6ATEpre, the first tool designed to predict cell-specific m6A sites with regulating translation efficiency (m6A-reg-TE). m6ATEpre integrates multi-omics data, including MeRIP-seq data, PAR-CLIP data and Ribo-seq data, introduces a novel feature representation strategy for m6A site sequences, and employs an autoencoder to effectively capture embedded feature representations.
